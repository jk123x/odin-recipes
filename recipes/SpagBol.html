        <li>250g Spaghetti</li>
        <li>800g crushed tomatoes/passata</li>
        <li>500g beef mince</li>
        <li>2 cubes beef boulignon (stock cubes)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce (or more, if you like flavour)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar (more if you have mediocre quality tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Parmesan, to serve</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti, for 1 minute less than the packet recommends</li>
        <li>Save one mug worth of pasta water for later, then drain the spaghetti</li>
        <li>Sautee garlic and onions on medium-high for three minutes</li>
        <li>Add beef, turn up to high, and break it up while it cooks. Cook until there's no red colour left to the meat.</li>
        <li>Add red wine (or replace with water), scrape the bottom of the pan as it reduces, for around one minute.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining ingredients. Stir, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally</li>
        <li>Add the pasta and pasta water and stir to combine. Cook for around 2 minutes, and then turn the heat off. Serve with generous amounts of parmesan. Enjoy!</li></lie>
